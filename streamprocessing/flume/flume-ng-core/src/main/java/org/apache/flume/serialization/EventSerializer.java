/**
 * <p>
 * This interface provides callbacks for important serialization-related events.
 * This allows generic implementations of serializers to be plugged in, allowing
 * implementations of this interface to do arbitrary header and message
 * formatting, as well as file and message framing.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The following general semantics should be used by drivers that call this
 * interface:
 *
 * <pre>
 * // open file (for example... or otherwise create some new stream)
 * OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(file); // open for create
 *
 * // build serializer using builder interface
 * EventSerializer serializer = builder.build(ctx, out);
 *
 * // hook to write header (since in this case we opened the file for create)
 * serializer.afterCreate();
 *
 * // write one or more events
 * serializer.write(event1);
 * serializer.write(event2);
 * serializer.write(event3);
 *
 * // periodically flush any internal buffers from EventSerializer.write()
 * serializer.flush();
 *
 * // The driver responsible for specifying and implementing its durability
 * // semantics (if any) for flushing or syncing the underlying stream.
 * out.flush();
 *
 * // when closing the file...
 *
 * // make sure we got all buffered events flushed from the serializer
 * serializer.flush();
 *
 * // write trailer before closing file
 * serializer.beforeClose();
 *
 * // Driver is responsible for flushing the underlying stream, if needed,
 * // before closing it.
 * out.flush();
 * out.close();
 * </pre>
 *
